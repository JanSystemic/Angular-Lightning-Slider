# Prerequisite
1. NodeJS
2. Angular CLI

# QUICK START
1. Download source code
2. Open terminal in the folder where you've downloaded the app
3. Run `npm run install-client-and-server` from your terminal. This will install the dependencies for Client/Server
4. Build the App for both Client and Server, by running `npm run build-client-and-server`from your terminal
5. Run the App by running `node public/server`
6. Open your browser, and navigate to: `localhost:3000` Enjoy!


# Developement

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `public/dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
